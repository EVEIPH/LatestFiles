EVE ISk per Hour Program/Patch Notes

Hi and thanks for checking out EVE IPH! I will update this file with patch notes and the version number or any other pertinent information you might want to know about the program files and versions.

Since this program is made for EVE Online, please contact me (Cwittofur Cesaille) in game, join the 'EVE-IPH' in game channel, or post on the EVE forums in the release thread for this program here: https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx'g=posts&m=727314

ISK donations accepted to Zifrian or cash through paypal at ZifrianEVE@gmail.com

Version 3.3

============================================
Known Issues:

* The window size is by design and does not allow Maximization at this time. This is by design.
* On the Blueprint Tab, when suggesting Buy items, sometimes there aren't enough items on the market to buy for the item being made even though the price is less than the build price. EVE Central does not allow for volume data per price, so this is only an estimate. Please use your discretion when comparing build/buy prices to the in game market.
* If the Update fails; run Eve Isk per Hour as administrator.

============================================

Build 3.3.6159.24346
* Regions and Systems will now correctly load when choosing the Copy activity from the facilities interface.
* Relics for T3 ship invention should now be loaded into invention calculations and material lists correctly.
* The Mining Tab will now correctly load the Endurance and Venture for Ice mining.
* The Endurance mining bonus is now correct.
* The number of miners available for mining frigates will now match the number of turret hardpoints and not high slots.

Build 3.3.6147.24931
* Updated database and images to YC_118.9.1.1
* Mining Tab updated to recent changes to barges (stats and turrets)
* Fixed bug on Blueprint Management that caused the program to crash if you selected the drop down for type when selecting a different item type besides ‘All’
* Thukker Mix Stations will now show up in facilities for selection.
* Added a new option on the BP Tab named 'Simple Copy', which when selected formats the 'Copy to Clipboard' output for use in multi-buy and applications like EVEpraisal.

Build 3.3.6043.38735
* Updated IPH and Updater to use .Net 4.6.1 - please update your .Net installation to ensure IPH runs correctly here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981
* Updated database and images to YC_118.6_1.1 - this has fixed issues with incorrect materials for Cenobite II's and Citadels.
* The mining tab now applies an isk charge to refining instead of minerals returned as changed with the Citadel patch. 6.67 standing is still required to get refining with no tax applied.
* Adding only invention/copy materials to the shopping list from the BP Tab will add the materials even if adding invention/copy materials to shopping list is turned off.
* Updating the ME on the BP tab no longer crashes the program.
* Double-clicking on an item to add to shopping list from the manufacturing tab no longer crashes the program.
* R.A.M.s will now show the correct build quantity for build/buy and correct buy quantity when buying is cheaper on the BP tab. When adding an item to the shopping list, the correct amounts will be inserted as well.
* The correct BP Build Time and Total Build Time will now show when the invention time or copy time checks are selected. This had an effect of decreasing the IPH when more runs were added.
* The Manufacturing list will now properly refresh when no items found.

Build 3.3.6009.16436

* Update for the new CREST Calls.

Build 3.3.6001.35157

New build - 3.3.5990.40572

* Citadels should now show up in Update Prices
* Structure Modules have been added as Blueprint or Item option to the Manufacturing and Item Prices tabs respectively.
* Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow corrupted facility xml settings to load default facilities. Users will still need to resave their facilities if they did not load on startup and received an error message.

Build 3.3.5989.40086

* Fixed an issue where typing in the blueprint combo box with owned or favorites selected would crash the program.
* FAX ships should now be able to be built in lowsec stations and outposts.
* Errors of "file path not found" during the update process should now be fixed.

* The options on the BP Tab, BP Viewer, and BP Management have been made the same. Users should see the same blueprints for options selected.
* Added text search to the BP Viewer screen.
* Added the 'Rebuild Items when Loading List' to the shopping list window. When selected (Default setting), items saved in your shopping list will be rebuilt and all items will be loaded as if you just added the item but did no adjustments (e.g. removed items or adjusted quantity). When unchecked, the shopping list will load with only the items you originally saved and only update the prices of those items. For example, if you only saved invention materials for a set of items, it will only load those invention materials for the items.

Bug Fixes
* Sorting in the BP combo and text search should now work correctly for all items

* Fixed Reprocessing Efficiency combo from requiring Reprocessing V to enable (Now requires IV)

Build 3.3.5971.5173

* App sometimes crashes on load, potential fix here

Build 3.3.5971.1011

* Changed Blueprint List to have more accuracy with results.
* Updated Database to latest Citadel Release (1.4).

Build 3.3.5963.35462

* Improved BP List Speed
* Fighter Drones now show up when Drones is selected in the BP List
* Fixed a couple instances where crashes occurred when double clicking empty items in a list.

Build 3.3.5963.35462

* Fixed issue where Blueprint Search text box would become unresponsive.
* Fixed issue where Corp Assets weren't being included in material list.
* Double-Click will now select all text in the Blueprint Box.

Build 3.3.5962.37867

Database updated to the Citadel Release

New Features:

1) Blueprint Selection re-vamped. The text box now has fully integrated search. You can type in any part of a blueprint name and it will display a list of items matching the criteria. You can use the up/down arrow on your keyboard or double-click on an item to load it.

2) Blueprint List - This opens a new window which will display a hierarchical view of Blueprints. (It does take a couple seconds to load; that's a known issue). From here, the original functionality of searching based on Ship, Drone, Modules, etc. As well as by size is implemented. The window will remain open until closed. While the window is open you can double-click on any blueprint to load it. This provides a faster lookup than searching each time.

3) Compressed Ore Calculations - Enabled by checking the "Compressed Ore" checkbox at the bottom of the window. This will calculate Compressed Ore quantities and types based on Null Sec Ore (for now) which will provide you the minerals you need to build your desired item. That being said there are some caveats to this:

3a) If using a station, the station's refine rate will be calculated. If using a POS it will calculate based off a 52% refine rate. If using an Outpost it will calculate based off a 50% refine rate. This will be enhanced in a future version.

3b) This does take into account the users' skills as well as Beancounter implants.

3c) The location chosen for the manufacturing will be used to calculate the ore needed. Perhaps in a future release I will implement the option to refine at a different location other than where the item is being built.

3d) In order for the data to be calculated you need to click the "Refresh" button. You only need to do this once, as long as the application is running. When the application is restarted the checkbox will be unchecked.


Version 3.2

Build 3.2.5937.20769
* Updated to the YC-118-3_1.0 DB and Images

Build 3.2.5902.34671
* R.A.M. materials should now take into account the porition size of each run for items using more than one blueprint.
* BPs should no longer double up with corp bps of the same type and ME. Users will have to reset the blueprints or manually update the duplicates to get this update.
* The Thukker should no longer show up for systems that are not low-sec when selected in facilities.
* Updated the shopping list to take into account building components with just one blueprint. This should result in more exact quantities if using 1 bp to build components instead of a few extra materials left over at the end of component runs.
* Selecting an item from the manufacturing tab and pressing Ctrl + C will copy the blueprint name to the clipboard
* Not loading the settings for optimal iph/profit
* Hauler m3 values should now save and reload on the mining tab properly
* Shopping lists will now load correctly for those saved with outpost facilities

* The optimal profit/iph decryptor check box will now save with settings.
* Updating the price for a single item from CCP Data should now work correctly.
* Current buy/sell orders on the manufacturing tab will no longer limit by date but live data.
* Added a timeout check if updating from CCP prices locks up / hangs. Data is saved up to that point so just try your price updates again if you see this error.

Build 3.2.5873.19500 – CREST Market Prices Integration - January 30, 2016

Bug Fixes
* Blueprints should now be selectable from the drop down and mouse after using the arrow keys to select in the blueprint combo.

New Features

Database Update
* Updated EVE IPH database and images to YC-118-1_1.0_116645

SVR Updates
* Sales to Volume Ratio (SVR) data for the Manufacturing tab will now be updated and caculated with from CCP (CREST) data.
* All SVR Settings (Threshold, Days, Region) are now saved in the Application Settings for use on multiple forms.
* Removed all EMD references for market history to use CCP data, which is more accurate and complete.

BP Tab
* Users can now toggle profit or profit percent by double clicking on the Raw or Component Profit labels. The type of profit show will persist and be saved when BP settings are saved.
* SVR data has been added to the BP tab - Users can set the BP tab to automatically update SVR data in settings or with automatic update off, manually by double-clicking the SVR labels. The default is to automatically update on the BP tab. Note: the load time for calculations for BPs that require updating the market history will take a little longer on first load each day but then will use cached data for future calculations.
* Users can now move forward and back from previously viewed BPs. Use the forward and back buttons (top right corner of Raw Material List) or forward/back mouse buttons to go back and forth through the BP History. This functionality saves information on facilities, BP data (ME/TE), for each BP in the history and updates them when changed. To clear the BP history, select 'Clear BP History' from the Edit menu.

Manufacturing Tab
* Users can now right-click a single item on the Manufacturing list and display the market history for the item. The settings on the Market History Viewer are similar to in-game with the addition of a Linear trend line option.
* Renamed 'SVR Settings' Frame to 'Market History Settings'
 - Note: Average days is no longer just used for SVR but is used for all market history calculations.
* The following columns have been added to the Manufacturing List:
 - Price Trend – Linear trend of prices for the days entered in Average Days under Market History Settings. Value is displayed as a positive or negative percent but a red or green arrow has been added to help determine trend direction as well.
 - Total Items Sold – Total items sold over for the days entered in Average Days under Market History Settings.
 - Total Orders Filled – Total orders completed for the days entered in Average Days under Market History Settings.
 - Average Items Per Order – Orders divided by Items Sold for the days entered in Average Days under Market History settings.
 - Current Sell Orders – The current number of Sell Orders on the market for the Region selected in Market History Settings. Note, these orders are filled from CCP data from the Update Prices tab and will show nothing if not updated.
 - Current Buy Orders – The current number of Buy Orders on the market for the Region selected in Market History Settings. Note, these orders are filled from CCP data from the Update Prices tab and will show nothing if not updated.
 - Items in Production – The current number of the items that you are currently producing on all characters.
 - Items in Stock – The current number of items in stock at the asset locations set by the assets window launched by clicking on the 'Safe' Icon on the manufacturing tab.
* Users can now select 'Optimal' for a decryptor calc function. It is a tri-check that allows no optimal comparison (unchecked), optimal IPH (checked), optimal profit (tri-check).
* The Tech Level has had the Tech image added to the row for T2, T3, Storyline, and Faction items. 
* Added Market filtering options to the Manufacturing tab to include the following:
 - Price Trend – Up/Down/All based on CCP Market History data.
 - Total Volume Threshold – if volume is greater than entry, include record. Note: you must download price data from CCP for this functionality. Also, this is the total volume of items sold and will filter the 'Total Items Sold' column in the manufacturing list, not the total volume produced from the bps.
 - Total IPH Threshold – if IPH is greater than entry, include record. 
 - Total Profit Threshold – if profit is greater than entry, include record. 
 - Min/Max Build times – if the total production time is greater than or less than the min/max time, the record is included.
 - Add time check to manufacturing tab – ie. I only want stuff between 22 and 24 hours
* SVR Settings has been removed and options have been moved to the Market Filters
* Removed the option to ignore 'Items I can Reverse Engineer'. T3 items will check the 'Items I can Invent Flag' now to determine including in the list. Note, text colors highlighting T3 invention or T2 invention will remain unchanged.
* Users can now right-click on the manufacturing tab and add multiple blueprints to the shopping list if selected.

Update Prices Tab
* Redesigned the update prices tab to allow for downloading prices from CCP (Direct game data) or EVE Central. Additionally, added the option to set up a Price Profile, which splits up the locations you want to download different prices (E.g. you buy minerals in Hek, sell ships in Jita, sell modules in Amarr).
* CCP Data - Users can now download live price data from the EVE Servers by selecting the radio button 'CCP Data' or continue using 'EVE Central'. Note CCP data will likely be slower than using EVE Central but more accurate as it is live prices from the game. Note, only one region at a time can be used to update prices when 'CCP Data' is selected.
* Price Profiles – Users can select to use a price profile, which allows downloads from any system/region for the shown categories. Users can select a price type, region, and system (Select 'All Systems' to use the regional price) for each category and assign a price modifier for each category as well. Note: you can only select one region for this functionality.
* The Manual Price update button 'Update Prices' has been replaced with a 'Cancel Update' button that will cancel price updates when pressed. Users can still manually update prices from the Edit menu.
* Users can now add a percentage of the price to the imported price by entering a percentage in the 'Price Modifier' text box for Raw Materials or Manufactured items. For instance, if you sell items at 10% more than Jita price at your null sec outpost, you can add 10% to all the prices you import to show the prices at which to sell items. Price modifiers are also available in the Price Profile.
* Added tool tips to the price type drop downs for short explainations of the different options.
* Users may now save and load prices from files in the default file format (CSV, SSV, TXT). The prices saved will only be those loaded into the grid (e.g. If you just have minerals loaded, only the mineral prices are saved). Additionally, when loading prices, only the prices in the saved file are loaded and the prices in the file will overwrite the program prices until the user initiates the next download within IPH.

General
* Changed the 'Character Loaded' label on the bottom strip to a menu of all loaded characters to allow easy and quick switching to a new default character. Note the menu has a maxium of 20 Characters.
* Users can now ignore multiple blueprints in the Manufacturing tab by selecting multiple rows, right clicking, and selecting 'Ignore Blueprint'
* Removed the Assets menu item from the view menu as it wasn't used for anything. 
* Region drop downs will no longer show wormhole regions for market data, with the exeption of G-R00031 (Thera).
* Text searches on the Manufacturing, Blueprint Management, and Update Prices have added functionality. Now users limit searches by separate multiple items with commas, or adding 'NOT' at the beginning or in the middle of the text. Searches are not case sensitive and searches the item name and group for filtering. For example:
 - 'mining crystal not rig, jaspet' - shows mining crystals but not the mercoxit mining crystal rig or jaspet mining crystals
 - 'Hulk, Mackinaw, Skiff' – will only show these three ships
 - 'NOT Hulk, Mackinaw, Skiff' - don't want these three but all other items
* Added the ability to set a Proxy in settings to include the HTTP/HTTPS proxy address and port (set port to 0 for no port number). Please let me know if you use a proxy and cannot get this setting to work or require additional information to input.
* The teams window has been removed from the manufacturing tab until teams are reintroduced.

New Stuff
* Users can now update the price of an item on the BP tab by clicking on the box below 'Market Price' label. When this is updated, it is saved for the entire program until updated again.
* FW system bonuses can now be set on the BP tab in Options and selected for items in the Manufacturing tab. On the BP tab, the values are saved for the system and will apply when using that system for calculations. On the manufacturing tab, the values are added to the appropriate facility (Manufacturing, Copying, etc.) in calculations.
* All sorting options have been removed from the following tabs and are now saved with settings based on the column clicked by the user: Blueprints, Update Prices, Manufacturing, Datacores, and Mining. Others will be updated as necessary. Note: all lists in the program are now sortable by clicking on the column to sort.
* The Endurance and various Ice Miners for the Prospect and Endurance have been added to the mining tab. Both the Prospect and Endurance are available for selection for Ice Mining. 
* Added Capital Component facility fields to the Manufacturing tab.

Build 3.1.5728.21730

* Updated DB and Images to Galatea_1.0_114618
* All Outposts, Outpost Upgrades, and Upgrade Platforms have been added back to the program. These are inserted as special "Blueprints" to help determine materials needed to build an Outpost or apply upgrades. Users can apply prices for items not on the market in Item Prices. Note: Please see other 3rd party documentation on how outpost and outpost upgrade construction is different than building typical items.
* System Indexes will now show next to the system name in the Facility System Drop-down.

* Saving a facility on the manufacturing tab should now correctly set the default flag.
* The SSV format should now correctly save with commas in the place of decimals when using the Copy to Clipboard button on the BP Tab.


Build 3.1.5678.27159

Shopping List
* Added column to display the total fees per item in the buy list when using Buy Orders.
* The total cost of the items will now include fees in the buy list when using Buy Orders.
* Added the facility name to the Item list where the item will be built. For POS structures, the system name has been added to the array used.
* Added label showing how many total items are in the shopping list. Useful for large shopping lists.
* Fixed issue where changing the number of T2 items in the shopping list added as 'Components' only would crash the program.

Misc.
* Double-clicking on the 'Default Facility' label when greyed out will now load the default facility on the BP and Manufacturing Tabs.
* The 'Default Facility' label will now show when a default facility is loaded again on the BP and Manufacturing tabs.

* Fuel blocks can now be built at POS facilities.
* Changing the number of T1 items in the shopping list should no longer crash the program.

Build 3.1.5671.35252
* Updated to Aegis_1.0_114220 Database and Images
* Industry jobs will now update for all checked alt accounts in the list without needing to load the character
* The total cost on the shopping list now reflects the total cost of the shopping list and not the original cost entered. If users update the items, the cost will reflect those changes.
* Removed taxes and fees check boxes for items on the shopping list. The shopping list is intended for shopping, not selling. Future updates may incorporate taxes for selling items but for now they are removed.
* Added invention and copy costs (does not include usage) to the shopping list.
* Blue highlights on records users can invent (they have the T1 BP) and T3 Invented items should now show for both All Blueprints and Owned Blueprints and show the correct settings selected.
* Fixed an issue where invention and copy materials were not updated correctly when changing values of items in the shopping list.
* Items that have components built with components (e.g. Jump freighters) now display the correct amount of materials to build all levels of components on the BP list. The lists will now contain the correct amount of buy materials, and the raw and component costs for all levels and will be the same when using build/buy.
* Made a small adjustment to build/buy calculations to take into account the total build cost of the component (usage, etc) instead of just the material cost for making a build or buy determination.
* User settings (Default ME/TE and Suggest Build BP if Not Owned) were sometimes not set correctly in blueprint calculations; this has been corrected.
* Changed all forms to use DPI scaling so that users with 125% and 150% scaling set to their version of windows won't see overlapping controls and poor quality. Note: Users of Chinese Windows may still experience issues with overlapping controls. Anyone that has an issue with this, please send me a screenshot and details of your settings. 
* Updated error on Industry Upgrade Belts tool that gave incorrect ore volume values resulting in overly high IPH rates per belt.
* Updated ores in the Industry Upgrade Belts tool to be correct with the asteroids and total quantity in the belts.
* The Compress Ore check will now use compressed ore prices for determining IPH in the Industry Upgrade Belts tool 

Build 3.1.5663.27046
* Fixed an issue where copy and invention usage was being multiplied by the number of runs incorrectly, resulting in large differences in IPH and profit calculations with large number of runs.
* Prices for amarr and gallente starship engineering datacores will now show correctly on the datacores tab
* Auto num bps updates when entering runs should no longer give large numbers for T1 items
* The BPC needed for invention has been added to a tool tip for Invention chance for T2 items
* Fixed an issue where the amounts for components and raw materials (not build/buy) were the same in all cases. Now the correct differences will be displayed.
* Fixed the approximate calculations in the shopping list. Shopping List stats should be the same as the BP tab (for a single item) but the only difference is that it will show how the broker fees for setting up a buy order will change the IPH and profit. 

Build 3.1.5655.35622
* Fixed an issue where opening assets with items in space (ships, towers, etc) would not load and crash the program
* Fixed an issue where the number of runs on an invented blueprint were not taken into account in calculations and would lead to incorrect  numbers for any runs over 1
* Changed the forms to all ignore windows scaling. If you have scaling to 125% or 150% (or a version of windows with an off scaling amount - e.g. Chinese) then you shouldn't notice boxes and text overlapping other controls. Please let me know if you notice issues with this change.
* Removed Data interfaces check box from update prices tab and moved 'Items with no price' up
* Locations on datacores now shows station name, security, and region again
* On the BP tab, BPCs will now correctly load the decryptor that was used to make it, if available. If not, then it will show 'Unknown' and uncheck the costs and time boxes in invention
* Fixed the approximate calculations in the shopping list. Shopping List stats should be the same as the BP tab (for a single item) but the only difference is that it will show how the broker fees for setting up a buy order will change the IPH and profit.

Build 3.1.5649.26563

Bug fixes
* Setting a POS facility on the manufacturing tab will save locally
* The manufacturing tab will no longer show component usage for component built items
* Invention and copy usage will now be more accurate for total bp costs
* Fixed a minor issue on the manufacturing tab to show correct values when compared to the bp tab
* Build/Buy values should be the same on the components or raw material lists on the bp tab now.
* Ignore invention check works more consistently now
* Processing of Settings files were updated and should no longer crash the program but may require users to re-save their settings files to load correctly
* Set the same font for all objects, so loading IPH on different systems should be more consistent.
* Users should now be able to import prices for the Antikythera Element from EVE Central
* Saving settings on the BP tab with the 'Save Relics and Decryptors on BP Tab' setting selected in the application settings will now correctly save relics and Decryptors again for future loading

* S/M/L/XL check boxes should work for all items now
* T2 BPO processing should work more consistently now on the BP tab
* Copy and invention usage should now be correctly included in the total production costs
* Component usage will no longer apply to the total production cost for component lists
* Fixed crash when you uncheck ignore invention and ignore invention costs with multiple blueprints

Blueprint Management
* Blueprints are now stored as one of 4 types - BPO, BPC, Unowned, or Invented BPC
* Import and export of blueprint data updated to new types - importing under the old type will not set the owned bps to invented bpcs on import, so double check your bps
* The importing of bps will attempt to set the data to Invented BPC if the ME/TE/Runs correspond to a Decryptor and relic combination
* If the values sent to do not support a combination, it will be saved as a BPC (pre-cirus for instance)
* Users can now set ignored or favorites on the blueprint management tab without saving it as owned.
* Added additional costs and runs information to the blueprint management tab
* The search box for BP Management will now work with NOT (like the manufacturing tab)
* Removed option to set a copy on the update all settings
* Saving a blueprint from the BP tab when 'Ignore Invention' is selected in options will save the bp as a BPO, all others will be saved as BPC or Invented BPC

Ignore blueprints now added
* On the manufacturing tab, users can right click the blueprint to ignore it from calculations
* In Blueprint Management, users can set several bps as ignore at the same time
* Ignored bps are for all characters and can be reset in blueprint management
* Removed the 'Ignore Rare BPs' setting in application settings

Manufacturing Tab
* Ignored blueprints will not show on the manufacturing tab
* Owned blueprints in the manufacturing tab will take into account the Decryptor and relic used to create Invented BPCs. If you do not have the correct options selected for what you used to build the BPC, it will not show on the list.
* Owned BPCs and BPOs for T2 and T3 will be shown next to other BPs with the Decryptor and Relic options for comparision
* The BP Type column in the manufacturing tab shows the type of blueprint with new blueprint types


Build 3.1.5624.32344

Bug Fixes
* When using multiple BPs in BP and Manufacturing tabs, the total production times were higher than expected when using multiple blueprints and resulting in lower IPH. This has been corrected.
* When using multiple BPs, IPH was assuming for each BP the user would run a separate batch of components for each BP. This resulted in incorrect rounding (up) of materials and was inconsistent with shopping list updates (it's also not the most efficient). Now IPH will assume the user will build all components first in one large batch prior to running each bp. This will result in fewer component materials for larger num bps and shopping list updates will be consistent as well.
* Searching for a BP Material by text search in the Assets window will no longer crash the program.
* Refining moon materials on the Reaction tab should no longer crash the program.
* T3 items should now correctly show the ME and TE values when decryptors are used on the Manufacturing Tab
* Users should now be able to select different options on the Manufacturing tab facilities and run them without saving as default. Previously, IPH would load the saved (default) facilities back before calculating.
* Stations without industry or refining facilities should no longer show as 'Unknown' in Assets or in other areas where station names are used.
* Num BPs should not auto update to 1 when entering a number of bps and change the total runs
* Users should no longer get an error when opening some shopping lists from the shopping list window. If you still get errors, try rebuilding the list, saving and reloading. 
* Datacores should now correctly show skills for Gallente and Amarr Starship engineering
* Current Research Agents should now correctly show data for Gallentean and Amarrian datacores

Efficiency Updates
* The processing for updating station data from CREST has been optimized. Users should notice a long start up when first installing the program (and updating might take a bit more time) but future daily updates should take less time to process. 

Shopping List
* Enabled the ability to update the item quantity in the shopping list
* Shopping list updates should now work more consistently with the BP tab values
* Importing and exporting shopping lists has been improved. Imports will now use the MEs used to build the items and correctly select the BP facility used to build them. Note: Component and Cap Component facilities will always use the saved BP Component and Cap Component facilities to build.
* Updating shopping lists from the assets window should work correctly.

Blueprint Tab
* Usage has been removed from the popup box when double clicking Invention costs and Copy costs. These values are still used in calculations but not shown as an invention/copy cost. To view Usage values, double click the Usage check box on the Facility tab.
* Users can now select Ignore options for Invention, Minerals, and T1 base items for calculations by selecting the checks in the 'Options' tab.
* The Numbps box will now be disabled for T2 and T3 invented items. The number of blueprints needed to make the total number of items entered will be set from the decryptor and invention data.

Manufacturing Tab
* The column Total Manufacturing Cost was duplicated with Manufacturing Facility Usage and has been removed.
* Added column for SVR * IPH to the columns list.
* Users can now select Ignore options for Invention, Minerals, and T1 base items for calculations.

Mining Tab
* Users can now run calculations for Gas Mining if they did not have an ore type selected (e.g. Refined, Unrefined, Compressed). All gas is unrefined.
* Added a box for entering the number of miners you want to calculate - useful for answering that age old question, 'What is better, 2 miners plus orca or 3 miners?'
* User can now update the prices of Compressed and Unrefined ores in the mining grid. The Unit price for refined ore is based on the user skills and facility settings and cannot be updated. It's for comparison purposes only.

Misc.
* The industry upgrade belt tool has been updated with Mosaic values. Note: the number of asteroids may be off from in game amounts (total ore is correct).


Build 3.1.5596.30243

* Updated to Mosaic_1.0_112241 DB and Images (note images for new items currently missing from CCP).
* New sov upgrades and other sov item blueprints will now show up under Celestial options where used.
* Updated Outpost manual ME/TE settings - they should no longer error when incorrect data entered and updates will now affect the Materials and Build times correctly when set.
* Users can now save ME/TE and Tax values for Outposts. This data will persist across updates to industry facilities even if you change facility settings.
* Copy and invention usage should no longer be added to the buy list n the shopping list as an item to buy.
* Fixed several errors with importing and exporting shopping lists such as those suggesting 'Quantity' is an invalid type. 

Build 3.1.5561.38424

* Updated to Scylla DB and images
* Fixed issue that caused the program to crash when double-clicking on T3 destroyers in the manufacturing tab
* Clearing all data from the shopping list will now reset the usage and fees on the screen
* Made changes to CREST downloads that should improve performance some. 

Build 3.1.5558.14973

File Management
* If you have been using the testing files that you installed from the binaries zip file, to make sure you are on the new update path, just delete or rename the Test.txt file in your IPH directory.
* I will be deleting the files in the 'Testing' directory in a few weeks, so please update your files.
* New installs and binary zip files will not contain the Test.txt file so you will update from the normal location.
* If you are using 2.3, just open and run and the updates should work fine

Potential Issues

* The program may crash on startup due to issues with the settings files. I've tried to minimize these but if you have issues, try renaming the Settings folder first and then re-launching the program.
* Shopping List - The shopping list may still have issues with this change but most bugs have been corrected. Please send me any issues you find.

General

* The database and image files are updated to Tiamat_1.0_110751. This includes all previous database updates.
* All major industry and mining processing has been updated to work with the updates from Crius and Pheobe. 
* CREST data for Teams (not enabled), Facilities, and Market prices used in industry are available from the data menu. These updates are set to automatically download on startup but can be turned off in settings.
* Industry facilities have been added to the BP and Manufacturing tabs. Each facility is defined by its activity (Manufacturing, Invention, etc) and the type (Station, outpost, POS) to allow for the most flexibility in industry use. Once you have your facility set, hit save to set it as your default for the options chosen. A few details on facilities:
* All facilities are set to filter only facilities that users can build the items they have selected. For instance, if you are building drones a POS, the facility will only show a Drone Assembly Array as an option.
* If you select items with sov or security restrictions, IPH will take that into account for selecting facility types (you won't be able to use a cap ship assembly array in Jita for example).
* Selecting an Outpost will allow you to save additional information on ME and TE bonuses that are not available from CCP data.
* Teams were added, and then removed. The interface for teams is still visible but disabled until CCP determines updates to teams (or I need the space).
* The screen size has been adjusted to 4:3 ratio to allow for future resizing updates
* A 'SSV' option has been added to export types on the shopping list and other areas. SSV is semicolon separated and also outputs EU style decimals (e.g 1.000,00). 
* T3 production has been converted to invention and can now use Decryptors.
* Number of BPs used (NumBps) has been updated to work for the new industry changes. Currently a high number of BPs will slow the program down. A fix to make this processing more efficient will come next patch.

BP Tab

* The tab has been reorganized to allow for Facilities and Teams (not enabled). 
* BP facilities types and activities will automatically load for the BP selected. For instance, T1 items without components will only show manufacturing. However, a T2 item will show Copy, Invention, Manufacturing, and Component Manufacturing options. 
* All facilities will have a usage check for that facility type. This information is used in calculations including invention and copying. 
* The Calc tab for T2 and T3 will show invention and copy (T2 only) costs. These costs are in addition to usage and will include any materials (datacores, etc) to do the activity. For copying, most items will be 0 but in some cases (such as Cloaking devices), the materials' cost will be set here.
* Double-clicking interfaces have been added to labels for Invention and Copy Costs to see the materials and usage of the activity.
* Additional Costs are now saved with the Blueprint on the BP Tab
* Users can save relics and Decryptor types when saving a BP if selected in settings.

Update Prices

* New items from previous DBs are now available
* Percentile pricing should now use the correct prices

Manufacturing Tab

* Several types of Facilities have been added to the manufacturing tab. Each type will allow users to set specific facilities to build various groups of items such as capitals, supers, and items that cannot be built in a pos (sov items).
* Several new columns have been added to the list of fields users can choose on the tab. Default columns are similar to v2.3. Users can also move the order and resize the width of the columns in the table. 
* Num BPs has been added to the options with runs and lines.

Datacores - Gallente and Amarr datacore skills should now correctly show in the comparison table.

Reactions Tab - Reactions were updated with the reaction types

Mining Tab

* All reprocessing formulas and changes with Crius mining changes are live.
* The data grid now will show what type of ore processing type to allow comparison of Refined, Compressed, and Unrefined ores together based on the options selected. 
* Includes name changes to mining lasers.

BP Management

* Blueprint data is now downloaded via the API automatically on startup (unless disabled in settings). Please delete your old BP list if needed to get a fresh set of downloads. Multiple BP support is still not available.
* Only BPOs with the highest ME value are automatically set as owned.
* Additional options to assist in updating BPs has been added.

Industry Jobs

* Industry jobs have been updated for the updates to the industry API. Current and history are available as per the length of viewable time per CCP.
* Users can now view the industry jobs of any character they have loaded in the Account Management area with the correct rights. 
* Users can select the characters in the right hand corner to update the industry jobs.
* New columns have been added to the industry jobs viewer.
* The number of current and total jobs will be shown next to the character name in the list of characters (2/10 = 2 jobs of 10 possible)

Disabled Features due to updates

* The Industry Success tool has been disabled until a work around with the new API is identified
* The POS settings have been temporarily disabled.
* The ignore options on the BP tab have been temporarily removed.
* Data for stations and station upgrades have been temporarily removed.

* Scanning Corp and Personal blueprints should no longer cause a program crash when the user has no Corp or Personal BPs.
* Fixed an issue with the Shopping list that would not update the correct build volume when adding or updating the quantity in the shopping list.

Build 2.3.5193.34942

* Items marked as Build/Buy should now load correct values in the Manufacturing Tab.
* Built item volumes in the Shopping List should now show correct values for more than one item.
* Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause the program to crash after opening the asset window on the shopping list.
* Fixed an error that would crash the program when Calculating Owned BPs on the Manufacturing tab when there are no Owned BPs set.
* Searching text with apostrophes in the BP management search box should no longer crash the program.
* Changed the labels 'Can/Cannot Build this Item' and 'Can/Cannot Build the Components for this Item' on the BP tab to Double Click instead of Click.

Build 2.3.5188.30573

New Stuff

Asset Viewer
* Added a new Asset Viewer for Personal and Corp assets, which will show locations for all assets based on your API.
* Users can select the new Asset Viewer for viewing from the View menu or from the button on the Shopping list.
* Users can update Assets and timers for each type of Asset API will be displayed when the next API query is allowed. 
* Saving settings on the Asset Viewer will save the locations of boxes checked in the Asset tree as well as any search settings. 
* Search settings are similar to the Update Prices but can be separated by build items (anything you could use in a BP).
* Selected items will NOT auto-select containers that are children of the tree node. This is by design. If a builder were to want to update a shopping list with all items they have in Jita 4-4, including containers, they need to select all containers as well. 
* Saving settings from the View * > Assets selection has limited functionality currently. 
* For items in Space (POS towers), the Asset Viewer currently only shows limited information and does not link particular POS modules to a specific tower. This is a limitation of the Asset API and will be corrected (hopefully) in a future update.

Industry Upgrade Belts Tool 
* Added a new tool under the Tools menu that displays IPH per Industry upgrade belts assuming a full flip.
* Users can enter the number of miners in their fleet, average cycle time, m3 per cycle, and Refining Station data to see IPH, Ore Volume, approximate total ISK, and approximate hours to flip.
* Added options for ore types by truesec of the system
* Added options to include broker fees and taxes, as well as compression for determining total Ore Volume of the belt.
* Under each belt, users can select ores they want to ignore if they are looking to 'Cherry Pick' for instance.

Completely Rebuilt Shopping List
* Rebuilt the shopping list to give more room, functionality, options, and update with Assets.

Asset update 
* Click on the Safe icon to open the Asset Viewer for selecting the update location for the Shopping List. Any settings saved for this Asset Viewer will apply only to the Shopping List. 
* Clicking on the 'Update with Selected Assets' will update the shopping list and remove quantities of materials you have on hand. 
* Clicking on the 'Copy and Paste Assets' will allow users to copy and paste materials from the in game hanger view (list of assets, not icons) and paste them into the shopping list for update. The Rule for any list pasted into the list is Name of Item, Quantity. 
* If the 'Update Assets When Used' option is selected, IPH will update your currently stored assets by subtracting 'Used' materials in the shopping list after Updating with Selected Assets.

Save and Load shopping lists
* Saving a shopping list will output the list to csv format. 
* Loading a shopping list must be in the same format as the saved list but will update the shopping list based on the current BP Tab options selected (i.e. Build/Buy). If users save different quantities of materials, or do not include materials in the list, then loading a list will take that into account. For example, Item A takes 1000 Trit to build but was updated to 500 Trit then the list was saved. When loading the list, an option on the BP tab adds 100 Trit to the build requirements giving 1100 needed. Based on saved list data, the shopping list will update to 600 Trit to buy.

Updating / Deleting
* Users can remove any item, component, or material from the lists buy right clicking and choosing 'Delete'
* To delete multiple items from the list, hold control and click each row you want to delete and right click, choose Delete.
* Users can update Quantity and Price in the Items to Buy list. Price updates will apply to the entire program. 
* Users can update the Quantity in the Items and Components to Build lists.
* If a user updates the total amount of materials in the Buy list, then updates quantity in the Components or Items lists, IPH will take into account the amount of that material you have 'on hand' as indicated through your update (i.e. if you need 1000 and you change the quantity to 400, that means you have 600 on-hand).

Broker Fees
* Brokers fees for items you buy on market will be applied in the shopping list. Fees will apply for all items marked with 'Buy Order' or as described in rules for 'Calculate Buy / Buy Order' option.
* Added a new column to the shopping list that IPH will display to help determine whether you should buy the item directly from the market or set up a buy order - sometimes it's cheaper to buy direct!
* When the 'Calculate Buy / Buy Order' option is selected, IPH will attempt to determine if it's better to set up a buy order or buy from posted sell orders (no tax/no fees).
* Rules for Broker Fee calculations:
-If the Fees is checked and Calculate Buy/Buy Order, then IPH will calculate difference.
-If the Fees is unchecked, IPH assumes then the user is buying all materials from active sell orders, and no Broker fee will be assigned.
-If Fees is checked and Calculate Buy/Buy Order is not, then IPH assumes the user is using all buy orders to obtain materials.
-If Fees is unchecked, then Calculate Buy/Buy Order will be disabled
-To calculate whether it the item is Buy/Buy Order based on stored prices, IPH uses the following rules:
* If the user enters a manual price, or imports any 'Sell' price - IPH uses that price as minimum sell and imports max buy
* If the user imports any 'Buy' or 'All' price then IPH uses that price as max buy and import minimum sell
* IPH will only use items marked with 'Buy Order' to calculate total Brokers Fees.

Other stuff
* Users can select the Item names from the lists for copy purposes only.
* Double-clicking on an Item or Component will load that Item or Component in the BP Tab.
* Added an 'Always on Top' option that will force the shopping list window on top of all other windows you have active on your computer - Useful for windowed mode shopping.
* Added Total Item Tax and Total Item Broker Fees which is the total tax and fees for the 'Items to Build' in the list. The Broker Fees here do not apply to the 'Fees' under options.

General Updates
* Augmented and Integrated drones are now set as 'Pirate' and not 'Navy' Types
* Refinery and Station Efficiency is now set as percentages instead of decimals (e.g. 5% vs. 0.05)
* Usage costs have been correctly updated. 
- Usage will now take into account Discount or Surcharge depending on values and standings set in program settings.
- Note 1) Usage is applied per run regardless of runs or bps. 
- Note 2) Usage values won't be exact because in game CCP rounds up corporation standings for display but uses unrounded values in calculations, so I can't get the exact value to do calculations.
* Renamed 'Tools' for selections to 'Misc.' on the BP, Update Prices, and Manufacturing Tabs. Misc. will include, Fuel Blocks, Implants, Data Interfaces, and Tools. For Update Prices, it includes random other items as well.

Blueprint Tab
* Added a 'Fees' check box and label for Brokers Fees in addition to Taxes and Usage. 
* Updated Taxes and Fees calculations. When 'Fees' is checked, brokers fees are applied to the item price only, as if the user is setting up a sell order for this item. Taxes will also apply to only the item only, as if a sell order is placed.
* Added Invention/RE Mats as a copy and add to shopping list option. When selected, any copy to clipboard or add to shopping list will put just copy the invention materials for the selected blueprint to the appropriate location.
* Double-clicking on the Invention Cost or RE Cost label for T2/T3 items will now show a popup with the respective Invention or RE materials for the selected blueprint.
* Added new BP selection buttons for Favorites, Deployables (Warp Bubbles, Mobile items), Celestials (Customs Offices, Containers, and Stations), and Station Parts.
* Added Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large/Capital options for BP selection. Drones and Ships are put into general categories; all other items will have the size in the name or indicated (i.e. Antimatter Charge S, Medium Shield Booster)
* IPH will no longer suggest buying materials without a price, or zero price, when build/buy is selected.
* Double-clicking on a component in the Component Material List will now load that BP in the BP tab with displayed ME and Runs.
* Added several tool tips to help clarify different areas.
* Outposts, Outpost upgrades, and Custom Offices have been added as 'Blueprints' and updated to act like other blueprints that take multiple components. For example, an Amarr Outpost will take an 'Egg' plus items to put in the Egg to deploy. Selecting the Amarr Outpost 'Blueprint' will now show the total items to deploy a full outpost. Upgrades and Customs offices work similarly.

Update Prices Tab
* Added Percentile prices for selection from EVE Central, which they define as: [If you sold to the top 5% (in volume, not just orders), and took the total price, that would be percentile. For sell, it's as if you've bought 5% of the market (in volume), lowest price first.] 
* The Shattered Villard Wheel can now have its price downloaded or set.
* Added Celestials, Deployables, and Implants to Price updates.
* Moved Station parts to Manufactured Items
* Outpost foundations can now have their price downloaded or set.

Datacores Tab
* Current Research agents are highlighted with blue text in the agent list. 
* Max IPH Research agents re highlighted with light green background in the agent list. 
* Low/Nullsec agents are highlighted in orange and red respectively. Highsec agents are marked with black text.
* The Current Research Agents window under the View menu will now show the total current value of datacores available for delivery.
* Added a color code box with tool tips to describe color coding of items in the agent list.

Manufacturing Tab
* Added Runs box to the options. IPH will assume users own the same number of BPs as the number of lines selected, and runs will calculate accordingly. 
* Added new BP Type selection buttons for Favorites, Deployables, Celestials, and Station Parts.
* Added Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large/Capital options for BP selection. 
* Added/Updated Decryptor Tool Tips for new Decryptors 
* T2 items that you have an owned T1 Blueprint of will now display as a light blue background in the manufacturing list.
* Added a color code box with tool tips to describe color coding of items in the manufacturing list.

Mining Tab
* Users can now select 'Gas' from the Ore Type drop down to compare gas harvesting. 
* Gas type locations are based on the following: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ladar_Site_List
* WH ore and gas types are based on the following: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gravimetric_Site_List
* Mining settings should be more helpful when selecting different ships.
* Added Wormhole space selection to 'Factions' with classes. Availability of different Gas types and Mercoxit are main differences between wormhole classes with respect to mining.

Blueprint Management
* BPCs will be removed from owned blueprints if the item is no longer part of a user's assets.
* Added new BP Type selection buttons for Favorites, Deployables, Celestials, and Station Parts.
* Added Small, Medium, Large, and Extra Large/Capital options for BP selection. 

Settings
* Added setting to disable sounds. Note: this only applies to sounds IPH triggers and not message box sounds, etc. from Windows.
* Added setting allowing assets to be automatically downloaded on startup. Note: Default is set to true.

* Added Asteroids to Update Price list for use in the Mining Tab and Compressed Blueprint Calculations.
* Returned item prices from EVE Central that are zero will no longer overwrite existing prices. In cases where EVE Central does not report a price, but you have one set, IPH will maintain the old price. This will help with manual price updates where EVE Central continually has no record to return.

Manufacturing Tab
* Added Production Time Modifier combo and all possible time modifiers.
* Added production runs to the Manufacturing Tab. This will be the total number of production lines that is used for manufacturing calculations to better reflect what you are building (i.e. 10 lines of Shield Booster II instead of 1 line per production run).

* Added Tooltip to Mining Foreman GangLink to highlight cycling through No Link, T1 or T2
* Added the ability to compare refining or not refining mined ice and ore, useful if you don't have good refining capabilities or want to just sell quickly and want to find the best ore or ice to mine. 
* If .75 refining yield is selected, calculations will assume a Refining Array is being used and will use calculations for Refining Arrays instead of Stations and cap the refining rate at .75.
* Shown yield rates were not accurately reflecting the true yield or affect by taxes. This has been fixed.

Shopping List
* Added ME values to shopping list exports for all items that have an ME value set in the program.
* Added the total built volume to the shopping list screen and copy exports. This will be the total volume of the items list after they are built.

Blueprint Management
* Sovereignty Structure Blueprints will now appear under 'Structures' in the Blueprint Selection Combo
* Selecting any option other than 'All Blueprints' will now automatically check all the blueprints in the main list.
* Added Backup and Load functionality for BP lists. The Backup button will save ALL blueprints into a csv file. Load will load that same file back into the program. If you change any data in the file, it will be reflected in the upload (i.e. ME/PE Data). If you remove any of the fields, your data will not load.
* Added tool tips explaining what is backed up and loaded for the Backup and Load BP buttons.

Program Settings
* Added Default Build/Buy and Default Build Equipment Modifier settings for use in the Blueprints and Manufacturing Tabs.

* Updated Invention Runs Formula based on Inferno Expansion Patch. Basic change to the invention runs formula is that max run BPCs are no longer required to get the 1 run from the BPC in addition to the Decryptor bonus. For example: A 1 run BPC before using a User Manual (+2 Runs) would result in 2 runs. After Inferno you get 3 (1 from BPC and +2 from Decryptor). Note: this change seems to work for my testing but let me know if you notice a discrepancy with the data on screen and what you expect.


Build 2.0.4525.30375
