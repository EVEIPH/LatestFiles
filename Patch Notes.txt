Bug Fixes
* The build price shown in the Components window on Blueprint tab will now correctly display the build cost of the component. Note, if there are excess sell materials this may not be exact if there are other components set to build as other components may use excess materials from other components instead of building them. 
* The total cost shown on the Components window on the Blueprint tab will now show the market cost and not the build cost when buy is selected.
* Build/Buy checks on the Components window will now translate across all blueprints and not just the one selected. 
* The excess material list will now correctly show the taxes and fees for selling this list.
* The built components list will now show the built component prie when excess sell materials on the component are factored in and the Built cost, which will not include excess sell components. For components, the excess materials are used by other components for the main blueprint and will only reflect the final excess of the main blueprint.
* Made several changes to make the excess material list and final output of components and raw items more accurate.
* Items with no volume in assets will no longer crash program from the reprocessing window when selected from assets.

* Users can now save manual ME and TE values, however if a rig is saved on the facility it will clear any manual values saved.
* Fixed an issue with copy/paste text windows that would crash the program when there was no quantity given for the items pasted in some cases.
* The shopping list will no longer retain the last items put into copy/paste assets window after used.
* Rig bonuses will now show correctly on facilities when the 'Share Facilities for each Character' is unchecked (e.g. users want to use the same facility for all characters loaded).
* Invention bonuses will now load correctly for facilities with rigs that have invention bonuses.

EVE Isk per Hour – Version 5.0 – Mining Update!

IPH Version 5.0 has several new things for mining, reprocessing, and conversion of raw materials from ice and ore into their minable versions. In addition, this version contains updated changes to the mining and update prices tab along with several bug fixes. As always, please join the discord to report bugs or ask questions about any of the new features.
Thank you for using IPH!

Build: 5.0.7904.31043

Conversion from Minerals and Ice Products to Ores
* On the Blueprint tab, in the Reprocessing Facility, added the option to 'Convert to Ore', which will convert any items in the Raw Material list to the types of Ores or Ices selected in the form when selecting 'Settings' in the Facility. The default setting is unchecked.
* When pressing the 'Settings' button in the Blueprint tab Reprocessing Facility, the Conversion to Ore Settings form will allow users to choose Ores and Ices by location, security, and variant to filter out ores or ices to convert. Additionally, users can choose to use compressed Ore and Ice and the option to minimize by refined price, the ore/ice price, or the ore/ice volume. Users can select / deselect ores or ices in the list to include / not include in the final calculations. Finally, if a user wants to ignore a certain output mineral or ice product, they can select it in the Ignore List and IPH will not consider that for conversion.
* When changing options in the Conversion to Ore Settings form, the settings will immediately take effect allowing users to try different options for conversion without re-loading the Blueprint.

Mining Tab Updates
Added support for drones throughout the mining tab for Mining and Ice Mining drones:
* Replaced the Jump Fuel Costs section with a mining drone selection option for the selected ships. Users can select the type, number, and appropriate skills for booster ship and mining drone ship. The total yield for each will be added to the Drone Yield column in the main output list.
* Added drop-down options for selecting 1-3 rigs for the mining ship (depending on ship type), to include mining rigs. Note, selected rigs in IPH may not work with in-game fitting.
* Added tri-checks for selecting None, T1, or T2 mining rigs for the booster ship. Note, selected rigs in IPH may not work with in-game fitting.
* Added a Reprocessing facility to allow for more accurate reprocessing amounts based on selected skills and facility fitting (if an upwell structure). When selecting the facility, the base reprocessing efficiency will be shown on the facility and depending on the rigs installed, the base refining yields will update for moon ore, regular ore, and ice depending on tab selections and setup.
* Note: The mining tab still uses the 'Beancounter' implant selected in application settings.
* Reorganized the Ore and Ice Processing skills section into specific tabs and added Triglavian Ore Processing skills to the section.
* Added 5% and 10% yield variants to Triglavian ores.
* Moon Ores will now show the type of Moon (e.g., R4) on the name of the Ore in the output grid.
* Replaced the Drake with the Gnosis as a booster ship.

Reprocessing Plant
* Users can now open the IPH Reprocessing Plant application from the Tools menu.
* The Reprocessing Plant allows users to select a facility for reprocessing and either paste assets or select from the asset viewer to reprocess. After assets are uploaded to the plant, users can uncheck or check items in the list for refining. 
* All relevant skills are included in the Skills tab. 
* The 'Beancounter' implant will use the implant selected in the Application Settings, however users can change the skill value locally in the Reprocessing Plant to see different outputs. 
* Added view for users to see all base facility refine yields before processing skills are accounted for.
* Added an option to 'Drill Down' reprocess items until there are no more items available for reprocessing. For example, a user could refine a freighter and then the capital parts returned would be then reprocessed again.
* The calculated Item List fields are:
 - Rate: The reprocessing rate for reprocessing the selected item
 - Refined Value: The total value, minus any reprocessing tax, of the reprocessed output.
 - % Return: The total reprocessed output divided by the total cost of the item reprocessed.
* The Reprocessing Output list shows the total reprocessing output, cost per item, and total cost and volume for that item. Note: this value does not include reprocessing usage charged.
* Users can see the total item list value of all checked items, the total reprocessing output of all checked items, the Return Rate (Total Output Value / Total List Value), and the total volume of Reprocessing Output at the bottom of the screen.

Mining Belt Flip Calculators
* Updated the Ore Sovereignty Belts tool with the new Reprocessing Plant facility and new ore amounts based on the April mining update.
* Added a new Ice Belt flip tool to load ice belts for various locations and calculate the total time, value, volume, and IPH of 'flipping' the Ice Belt.  

Update Prices 
* Redesigned the Updated Prices tab to match more closely to in-game categories and streamline selecting price locations. Many price checks have changed so check your settings before downloading prices.
* Removed all region checks and added a Region combobox and System combobox for selecting a Region for prices or a System not listed in the Trade Hubs.
* Added Perimeter as a Trade Hub.
* Users can now select Jita and Perimeter in Trade Hubs to download the best price between the two systems.
* Blueprint Copies now load all blueprint copies for use in invention calculations. Note, these are manual prices as they are not available for download. 
* When downloading prices from a system, IPH will no longer download prices from structures not in that system (e.g., Jita).
* Updated Price Profile options to match new price categories.
* Added an Open Market Browser button to the Update Prices tab that will open your default web browser to Eve Marketer.

Other updates

* Reprocessing Plants are affected by the Share Facilities option in Application Settings – when selected all Reprocessing Plants will use the same settings in the application.
* Saving a fitting for a structure will now save the facility as well.
* Built components in the components list calculations will now include usage in the total cost to build the item and not just the market cost. This cost will now no longer equal the raw cost in Build/Buy calculations but is more accurate.
* IPH will now automatically load and set to default when adding a character if no other characters besides the Dummy are loaded.
* Added the ability to reset all saved facilities to default in the Data, Reset menu.
* Users can now update any price in the Blueprint Tab tables, which will update the market price for that item.

Bug Fixes

Build 4.0.6964.22565

Note: Created a new Discord Channel for IPH. Please log-in here if you have questions or issues you want to discuss: https://discord.gg/rGMMqft

Price updates from Structures
* IPH will now download prices from public structures for the options selected on the Update Prices tab for Single (Region) Select and Price Profiles if the user has the following scopes added: esi-universe.read_structures.v1, esi-markets.structure_markets.v1 

Note, CCP only lists public structures that have no blocks on anyone docking. While you may see prices from a structure, not everyone may have access and the prices will not update for that structure through the price update without manually adding by structure ID (see new structure ID pricing feature). Additionally, anyone can set up a buy order anywhere and ESI will return data on those orders even if you don't have access to information about that structure. These buy order prices will not be reflected in update prices due the unavailability of region and solar system identification without access to that information.

* Users can now import prices on the Update Prices tab directly from a structure if it has a market and they can use it by importing with the Structure ID. The structure ID option is enabled on the Update Prices tab when the user has scopes esi-universe.read_structures.v1, esi-markets.structure_markets.v1 enabled. Then if a user wants to import prices from a structure, they follow the following steps through the Add Structure ID form on the Update Prices page:

1. Make a link of the market hub in the EVE Chat window. You can drag the station name from assets or type the name and select auto-link and then search for 'Station' and hit enter to put it in chat. Note, if you do not have access search will not work.
2. Right click the link and select Copy after entering the chat link.
3. Paste the text into the structure ID textbox - it will format the number for you.
4. Click check for Market. If there is no market available or you do not have access, the Structure ID will not be added.

These structure IDs will be kept in IPH until a user removes them from the View Saved Structures window and users can keep querying data from these markets until they no longer have access or the market/structure shuts down.

Account Management Improvements
* Users can now select their character and copy ESI token and scopes data for use in troubleshooting ESI issues.
* Users can now change the name of the 'Dummy Character' by going to Data menu, and selecting 'Change Dummy Character Name'.
* Updated dummy character skills to include basic industry, science, and mining skills. 
* Dummy character skills should now load correctly in the skills viewer.

Alpha Account Support
* Added a setting to allow max alpha skills to be added to the dummy character for use with Alpha accounts. Note, this option is only available when using the dummy character.
* Added a setting for indicating that the user is using an Alpha account. This will result in a 2% increase in the facility usage for blueprint costs when checked. Additionally, when checked, IPH will use the selected character's active skills to calculate costs.
* Added a setting to use Active skills over Trained skills. Useful if looking at a character that may have lapsed Omega.

ESI Improvements
* Implemented ESI error limiting, which should eliminate 420 errors users have seen in the past.
* Updated ESI error messaging and processing to provide more information and fewer, duplicate error messages on ESI errors and issues with character authentication and tokens.
* Added an ESI Status monitor for users to check the current status of used scopes within IPH. This form can be viewed by selecting the Data menu, and View ESI Status. Additionally, on startup ESI will now tell users if there may be an issue with the status of ESI queries, which may result in error messages and data unavailable. Users can choose to suppress these error messages in the settings.

Misc New 
* Updated Database and Images to January_Release_1.0_2019
* Implemented anonymous usage tracking using Google Analytics to track usage of IPH. Users can disable anonymous tracking in the program settings.
* Added a checkbox to the BP, BP Viewer, and Manufacturing tabs called 'NPC BPOs', which when checked, will allow users to see only blueprints that are sold by NPC corporations.

Build 4.0.6766.16381
* Added settings for using a proxy to main client and updater. Users need to enter proxy data in the IPH program Application Settings first, then the updater will use the same proxy settings. If there is an update upon installation, do not run the update but instead open the program and set the proxy settings first, then update. Note: I have limited options to test this so if it doesn't work, message me directly to see if I can figure it out with your options.
* Added a fix for "The requested scopes either don't exist, or are not valid for this client". Let me know if anyone still has issues with this. (Thanks to 'Ben' on github submission for finding the bug and fixing).

* Port has been removed as an option on registration. All users must set the Callback URL to: http://127.0.0.1:12500 exactly. If you get an error stating 'The callback URI doesn't match the value stored for this client' then check your callback URL to make sure it is exactly the address above. If it is not stored this way in the EVE registration form, then you will not be able to add characters through ESI SSO.
* When adding characters through EVE SSO, users can now cancel the request.
* A new scope has been added to allow checks for character access to corporation roles to use corporation assets, blueprints, and jobs. ALL USERS must update your registration to include the 'esi-corporations.read_corporation_membership' role and re-log into the SSO with each character you want this access to receive it. For example, if you have director and factory manager roles in your corporation, you will not be able to see corp blueprints, assets, or jobs until you re-add this character.

* Updated to the March2018Release_1.0 images and database
* EVE Swagger Interface (ESI)
- EVE IPH now uses ESI to make all API calls
- Setting up IPH to use ESI requires program registration. Instructions are located here: http://eveiph.github.io/ESIAuthorizationInstructions.html
- Users must add characters into IPH one at a time due to limitations with ESI. Use the Manage Accounts or Add Character options from the file menu to assist.
- All registration information, client id, secret keys, etc. are stored locally on the user's machine for security purposes. IPH will not save or store any of the information users use to register the program except in a text file named "AppRegistrationInformation.xml" in the installation or working folder.
- There may be problems with registering the program with an account that has only been paid for by plex. The work around is to register with an account that has paid for at least one month without plex.
- ESI is slow in some places and will be looked at for possible improvements in a future release.

When unchecked, the shopping list will load with only the items you originally saved and only update the prices of those items. For example, if you only saved invention materials for a set of items, it will only load those invention materials for the items.

Bug Fixes
* Sorting in the BP combo and text search should now work correctly for all items

* Double-Click will now select all text in the Blueprint Box.

Build 3.3.5962.37867

Database updated to the Citadel Release

New Features:

1) Blueprint Selection re-vamped. The text box now has fully integrated search. You can type in any part of a blueprint name and it will display a list of items matching the criteria. You can use the up/down arrow on your keyboard or double-click on an item to load it.

2) Blueprint List - This opens a new window which will display a hierarchical view of Blueprints. (It does take a couple seconds to load; that's a known issue). From here, the original functionality of searching based on Ship, Drone, Modules, etc. As well as by size is implemented. The window will remain open until closed. While the window is open you can double-click on any blueprint to load it. This provides a faster lookup than searching each time.

3) Compressed Ore Calculations - Enabled by checking the "Compressed Ore" checkbox at the bottom of the window. This will calculate Compressed Ore quantities and types based on Null Sec Ore (for now) which will provide you the minerals you need to build your desired item. That being said there are some caveats to this:

3a) If using a station, the station's refine rate will be calculated. If using a POS it will calculate based off a 52% refine rate. If using an Outpost it will calculate based off a 50% refine rate. This will be enhanced in a future version.

3b) This does take into account the users' skills as well as Beancounter implants.

3c) The location chosen for the manufacturing will be used to calculate the ore needed. Perhaps in a future release I will implement the option to refine at a different location other than where the item is being built.

3d) In order for the data to be calculated you need to click the "Refresh" button. You only need to do this once, as long as the application is running. When the application is restarted the checkbox will be unchecked.

* All SVR Settings (Threshold, Days, Region) are now saved in the Application Settings for use on multiple forms.
* Removed all EMD references for market history to use CCP data, which is more accurate and complete.

BP Tab
* Users can now toggle profit or profit percent by double clicking on the Raw or Component Profit labels. The type of profit show will persist and be saved when BP settings are saved.
* SVR data has been added to the BP tab - Users can set the BP tab to automatically update SVR data in settings or with automatic update off, manually by double-clicking the SVR labels. The default is to automatically update on the BP tab. Note: the load time for calculations for BPs that require updating the market history will take a little longer on first load each day but then will use cached data for future calculations.
* Users can now move forward and back from previously viewed BPs. Use the forward and back buttons (top right corner of Raw Material List) or forward/back mouse buttons to go back and forth through the BP History. This functionality saves information on facilities, BP data (ME/TE), for each BP in the history and updates them when changed. To clear the BP history, select 'Clear BP History' from the Edit menu.

Manufacturing Tab
* Users can now right-click a single item on the Manufacturing list and display the market history for the item. The settings on the Market History Viewer are similar to in-game with the addition of a Linear trend line option.
* Renamed 'SVR Settings' Frame to 'Market History Settings'
 - Note: Average days is no longer just used for SVR but is used for all market history calculations.
* The following columns have been added to the Manufacturing List:
 - Price Trend   Linear trend of prices for the days entered in Average Days under Market History Settings. Value is displayed as a positive or negative percent but a red or green arrow has been added to help determine trend direction as well.
 - Total Items Sold   Total items sold over for the days entered in Average Days under Market History Settings.
 - Total Orders Filled   Total orders completed for the days entered in Average Days under Market History Settings.
 - Average Items Per Order   Orders divided by Items Sold for the days entered in Average Days under Market History settings.
 - Current Sell Orders   The current number of Sell Orders on the market for the Region selected in Market History Settings. Note, these orders are filled from CCP data from the Update Prices tab and will show nothing if not updated.
 - Current Buy Orders   The current number of Buy Orders on the market for the Region selected in Market History Settings. Note, these orders are filled from CCP data from the Update Prices tab and will show nothing if not updated.
 - Items in Production   The current number of the items that you are currently producing on all characters.
 - Items in Stock   The current number of items in stock at the asset locations set by the assets window launched by clicking on the 'Safe' Icon on the manufacturing tab.
* Users can now select 'Optimal' for a decryptor calc function. It is a tri-check that allows no optimal comparison (unchecked), optimal IPH (checked), optimal profit (tri-check).
* The Tech Level has had the Tech image added to the row for T2, T3, Storyline, and Faction items. 
* Added Market filtering options to the Manufacturing tab to include the following:
 - Price Trend   Up/Down/All based on CCP Market History data.
 - Total Volume Threshold   if volume is greater than entry, include record. Note: you must download price data from CCP for this functionality. Also, this is the total volume of items sold and will filter the 'Total Items Sold' column in the manufacturing list, not the total volume produced from the bps.
 - Total IPH Threshold   if IPH is greater than entry, include record. 
 - Total Profit Threshold   if profit is greater than entry, include record. 
 - Min/Max Build times   if the total production time is greater than or less than the min/max time, the record is included.
 - Add time check to manufacturing tab   ie. I only want stuff between 22 and 24 hours
* SVR Settings has been removed and options have been moved to the Market Filters
* Removed the option to ignore 'Items I can Reverse Engineer'. T3 items will check the 'Items I can Invent Flag' now to determine including in the list. Note, text colors highlighting T3 invention or T2 invention will remain unchanged.
* Users can now right-click on the manufacturing tab and add multiple blueprints to the shopping list if selected.

Update Prices Tab
* Redesigned the update prices tab to allow for downloading prices from CCP (Direct game data) or EVE Central. Additionally, added the option to set up a Price Profile, which splits up the locations you want to download different prices (E.g. you buy minerals in Hek, sell ships in Jita, sell modules in Amarr).
* CCP Data - Users can now download live price data from the EVE Servers by selecting the radio button 'CCP Data' or continue using 'EVE Central'. Note CCP data will likely be slower than using EVE Central but more accurate as it is live prices from the game. Note, only one region at a time can be used to update prices when 'CCP Data' is selected.
* Price Profiles   Users can select to use a price profile, which allows downloads from any system/region for the shown categories. Users can select a price type, region, and system (Select 'All Systems' to use the regional price) for each category and assign a price modifier for each category as well. Note: you can only select one region for this functionality.
* The Manual Price update button 'Update Prices' has been replaced with a 'Cancel Update' button that will cancel price updates when pressed. Users can still manually update prices from the Edit menu.
* Users can now add a percentage of the price to the imported price by entering a percentage in the 'Price Modifier' text box for Raw Materials or Manufactured items. For instance, if you sell items at 10% more than Jita price at your null sec outpost, you can add 10% to all the prices you import to show the prices at which to sell items. Price modifiers are also available in the Price Profile.
* Added tool tips to the price type drop downs for short explainations of the different options.
* Users may now save and load prices from files in the default file format (CSV, SSV, TXT). The prices saved will only be those loaded into the grid (e.g. If you just have minerals loaded, only the mineral prices are saved). Additionally, when loading prices, only the prices in the saved file are loaded and the prices in the file will overwrite the program prices until the user initiates the next download within IPH.

General
* Changed the 'Character Loaded' label on the bottom strip to a menu of all loaded characters to allow easy and quick switching to a new default character. Note the menu has a maxium of 20 Characters.
* Users can now ignore multiple blueprints in the Manufacturing tab by selecting multiple rows, right clicking, and selecting 'Ignore Blueprint'
* Removed the Assets menu item from the view menu as it wasn't used for anything. 
* Region drop downs will no longer show wormhole regions for market data, with the exeption of G-R00031 (Thera).
* Text searches on the Manufacturing, Blueprint Management, and Update Prices have added functionality. Now users limit searches by separate multiple items with commas, or adding 'NOT' at the beginning or in the middle of the text. Searches are not case sensitive and searches the item name and group for filtering. For example:
 - 'mining crystal not rig, jaspet' - shows mining crystals but not the mercoxit mining crystal rig or jaspet mining crystals
 - 'Hulk, Mackinaw, Skiff'   will only show these three ships
 - 'NOT Hulk, Mackinaw, Skiff' - don't want these three but all other items
* Added the ability to set a Proxy in settings to include the HTTP/HTTPS proxy address and port (set port to 0 for no port number). Please let me know if you use a proxy and cannot get this setting to work or require additional information to input.
* The teams window has been removed from the manufacturing tab until teams are reintroduced.

* FW system bonuses can now be set on the BP tab in Options and selected for items in the Manufacturing tab. On the BP tab, the values are saved for the system and will apply when using that system for calculations. On the manufacturing tab, the values are added to the appropriate facility (Manufacturing, Copying, etc.) in calculations.
* All sorting options have been removed from the following tabs and are now saved with settings based on the column clicked by the user: Blueprints, Update Prices, Manufacturing, Datacores, and Mining. Others will be updated as necessary. Note: all lists in the program are now sortable by clicking on the column to sort.
* The Endurance and various Ice Miners for the Prospect and Endurance have been added to the mining tab. Both the Prospect and Endurance are available for selection for Ice Mining. 
* Added Capital Component facility fields to the Manufacturing tab.

Build 3.1.5671.35252
* Updated to Aegis_1.0_114220 Database and Images
* Industry jobs will now update for all checked alt accounts in the list without needing to load the character
* The total cost on the shopping list now reflects the total cost of the shopping list and not the original cost entered. If users update the items, the cost will reflect those changes.
* Removed taxes and fees check boxes for items on the shopping list. The shopping list is intended for shopping, not selling. Future updates may incorporate taxes for selling items but for now they are removed.
* Added invention and copy costs (does not include usage) to the shopping list.
* Blue highlights on records users can invent (they have the T1 BP) and T3 Invented items should now show for both All Blueprints and Owned Blueprints and show the correct settings selected.
* Fixed an issue where invention and copy materials were not updated correctly when changing values of items in the shopping list.
* Items that have components built with components (e.g. Jump freighters) now display the correct amount of materials to build all levels of components on the BP list. The lists will now contain the correct amount of buy materials, and the raw and component costs for all levels and will be the same when using build/buy.
* Made a small adjustment to build/buy calculations to take into account the total build cost of the component (usage, etc) instead of just the material cost for making a build or buy determination.
* User settings (Default ME/TE and Suggest Build BP if Not Owned) were sometimes not set correctly in blueprint calculations; this has been corrected.
* Changed all forms to use DPI scaling so that users with 125% and 150% scaling set to their version of windows won't see overlapping controls and poor quality. Note: Users of Chinese Windows may still experience issues with overlapping controls. Anyone that has an issue with this, please send me a screenshot and details of your settings. 
* Updated error on Industry Upgrade Belts tool that gave incorrect ore volume values resulting in overly high IPH rates per belt.
* Updated ores in the Industry Upgrade Belts tool to be correct with the asteroids and total quantity in the belts.
* The Compress Ore check will now use compressed ore prices for determining IPH in the Industry Upgrade Belts tool 

Build 3.1.5663.27046
* Fixed an issue where copy and invention usage was being multiplied by the number of runs incorrectly, resulting in large differences in IPH and profit calculations with large number of runs.
* Prices for amarr and gallente starship engineering datacores will now show correctly on the datacores tab
* Auto num bps updates when entering runs should no longer give large numbers for T1 items
* The BPC needed for invention has been added to a tool tip for Invention chance for T2 items
* Fixed an issue where the amounts for components and raw materials (not build/buy) were the same in all cases. Now the correct differences will be displayed.
* Fixed the approximate calculations in the shopping list. Shopping List stats should be the same as the BP tab (for a single item) but the only difference is that it will show how the broker fees for setting up a buy order will change the IPH and profit. 

Build 3.1.5655.35622
* Fixed an issue where opening assets with items in space (ships, towers, etc) would not load and crash the program
* Fixed an issue where the number of runs on an invented blueprint were not taken into account in calculations and would lead to incorrect  numbers for any runs over 1
* Changed the forms to all ignore windows scaling. If you have scaling to 125% or 150% (or a version of windows with an off scaling amount - e.g. Chinese) then you shouldn't notice boxes and text overlapping other controls. Please let me know if you notice issues with this change.
* Removed Data interfaces check box from update prices tab and moved 'Items with no price' up
* Locations on datacores now shows station name, security, and region again
* On the BP tab, BPCs will now correctly load the decryptor that was used to make it, if available. If not, then it will show 'Unknown' and uncheck the costs and time boxes in invention
* Fixed the approximate calculations in the shopping list. Shopping List stats should be the same as the BP tab (for a single item) but the only difference is that it will show how the broker fees for setting up a buy order will change the IPH and profit.

Build 3.1.5649.26563

Bug fixes
* Setting a POS facility on the manufacturing tab will save locally
* The manufacturing tab will no longer show component usage for component built items

* Component usage will no longer apply to the total production cost for component lists
* Fixed crash when you uncheck ignore invention and ignore invention costs with multiple blueprints

Blueprint Management
* Blueprints are now stored as one of 4 types - BPO, BPC, Unowned, or Invented BPC
* Import and export of blueprint data updated to new types - importing under the old type will not set the owned bps to invented bpcs on import, so double check your bps
* The importing of bps will attempt to set the data to Invented BPC if the ME/TE/Runs correspond to a Decryptor and relic combination
* If the values sent to do not support a combination, it will be saved as a BPC (pre-cirus for instance)
* Users can now set ignored or favorites on the blueprint management tab without saving it as owned.
* Added additional costs and runs information to the blueprint management tab
* The search box for BP Management will now work with NOT (like the manufacturing tab)
* Removed option to set a copy on the update all settings

* In Blueprint Management, users can set several bps as ignore at the same time
* Ignored bps are for all characters and can be reset in blueprint management
* Removed the 'Ignore Rare BPs' setting in application settings

Manufacturing Tab
* Ignored blueprints will not show on the manufacturing tab
* Owned blueprints in the manufacturing tab will take into account the Decryptor and relic used to create Invented BPCs. If you do not have the correct options selected for what you used to build the BPC, it will not show on the list.
* Owned BPCs and BPOs for T2 and T3 will be shown next to other BPs with the Decryptor and Relic options for comparision
* The BP Type column in the manufacturing tab shows the type of blueprint with new blueprint types


Build 3.1.5624.32344

Bug Fixes
* When using multiple BPs in BP and Manufacturing tabs, the total production times were higher than expected when using multiple blueprints and resulting in lower IPH. This has been corrected.
* When using multiple BPs, IPH was assuming for each BP the user would run a separate batch of components for each BP. This resulted in incorrect rounding (up) of materials and was inconsistent with shopping list updates (it's also not the most efficient). Now IPH will assume the user will build all components first in one large batch prior to running each bp. This will result in fewer component materials for larger num bps and shopping list updates will be consistent as well.
* Searching for a BP Material by text search in the Assets window will no longer crash the program.
* Refining moon materials on the Reaction tab should no longer crash the program.
* T3 items should now correctly show the ME and TE values when decryptors are used on the Manufacturing Tab
* Users should now be able to select different options on the Manufacturing tab facilities and run them without saving as default. Previously, IPH would load the saved (default) facilities back before calculating.
* Stations without industry or refining facilities should no longer show as 'Unknown' in Assets or in other areas where station names are used.
* Num BPs should not auto update to 1 when entering a number of bps and change the total runs
* Users should no longer get an error when opening some shopping lists from the shopping list window. If you still get errors, try rebuilding the list, saving and reloading. 
* Datacores should now correctly show skills for Gallente and Amarr Starship engineering
* Current Research Agents should now correctly show data for Gallentean and Amarrian datacores

Efficiency Updates
* The processing for updating station data from CREST has been optimized. Users should notice a long start up when first installing the program (and updating might take a bit more time) but future daily updates should take less time to process. 

Shopping List
* Enabled the ability to update the item quantity in the shopping list
* Shopping list updates should now work more consistently with the BP tab values
* Importing and exporting shopping lists has been improved. Imports will now use the MEs used to build the items and correctly select the BP facility used to build them. Note: Component and Cap Component facilities will always use the saved BP Component and Cap Component facilities to build.
* Updating shopping lists from the assets window should work correctly.

Blueprint Tab
* Usage has been removed from the popup box when double clicking Invention costs and Copy costs. These values are still used in calculations but not shown as an invention/copy cost. To view Usage values, double click the Usage check box on the Facility tab.
* Users can now select Ignore options for Invention, Minerals, and T1 base items for calculations by selecting the checks in the 'Options' tab.
* The Numbps box will now be disabled for T2 and T3 invented items. The number of blueprints needed to make the total number of items entered will be set from the decryptor and invention data.

Manufacturing Tab
* The column Total Manufacturing Cost was duplicated with Manufacturing Facility Usage and has been removed.
* Added column for SVR * IPH to the columns list.
* Users can now select Ignore options for Invention, Minerals, and T1 base items for calculations.

Mining Tab
* Users can now run calculations for Gas Mining if they did not have an ore type selected (e.g. Refined, Unrefined, Compressed). All gas is unrefined.
* Added a box for entering the number of miners you want to calculate - useful for answering that age old question, 'What is better, 2 miners plus orca or 3 miners?'
* User can now update the prices of Compressed and Unrefined ores in the mining grid. The Unit price for refined ore is based on the user skills and facility settings and cannot be updated. It's for comparison purposes only.

Misc.
* The industry upgrade belt tool has been updated with Mosaic values. Note: the number of asteroids may be off from in game amounts (total ore is correct).


Build 3.1.5596.30243

* Updated to Mosaic_1.0_112241 DB and Images (note images for new items currently missing from CCP).
* New sov upgrades and other sov item blueprints will now show up under Celestial options where used.
* Updated Outpost manual ME/TE settings - they should no longer error when incorrect data entered and updates will now affect the Materials and Build times correctly when set.
* Users can now save ME/TE and Tax values for Outposts. This data will persist across updates to industry facilities even if you change facility settings.
* Copy and invention usage should no longer be added to the buy list n the shopping list as an item to buy.
* Fixed several errors with importing and exporting shopping lists such as those suggesting 'Quantity' is an invalid type. 

Build 3.1.5561.38424

* Updated to Scylla DB and images
* Fixed issue that caused the program to crash when double-clicking on T3 destroyers in the manufacturing tab
* Clearing all data from the shopping list will now reset the usage and fees on the screen
* Made changes to CREST downloads that should improve performance some. 

Build 3.1.5558.14973

File Management
* If you have been using the testing files that you installed from the binaries zip file, to make sure you are on the new update path, just delete or rename the Test.txt file in your IPH directory.
* I will be deleting the files in the 'Testing' directory in a few weeks, so please update your files.
* New installs and binary zip files will not contain the Test.txt file so you will update from the normal location.
* If you are using 2.3, just open and run and the updates should work fine

Potential Issues

* The program may crash on startup due to issues with the settings files. I've tried to minimize these but if you have issues, try renaming the Settings folder first and then re-launching the program.
* Shopping List - The shopping list may still have issues with this change but most bugs have been corrected. Please send me any issues you find.

General

* The database and image files are updated to Tiamat_1.0_110751. This includes all previous database updates.
* All major industry and mining processing has been updated to work with the updates from Crius and Pheobe. 
* CREST data for Teams (not enabled), Facilities, and Market prices used in industry are available from the data menu. These updates are set to automatically download on startup but can be turned off in settings.
* Industry facilities have been added to the BP and Manufacturing tabs. Each facility is defined by its activity (Manufacturing, Invention, etc) and the type (Station, outpost, POS) to allow for the most flexibility in industry use. Once you have your facility set, hit save to set it as your default for the options chosen. A few details on facilities:
* All facilities are set to filter only facilities that users can build the items they have selected. For instance, if you are building drones a POS, the facility will only show a Drone Assembly Array as an option.
* If you select items with sov or security restrictions, IPH will take that into account for selecting facility types (you won't be able to use a cap ship assembly array in Jita for example).
* Selecting an Outpost will allow you to save additional information on ME and TE bonuses that are not available from CCP data.
* Teams were added, and then removed. The interface for teams is still visible but disabled until CCP determines updates to teams (or I need the space).
* The screen size has been adjusted to 4:3 ratio to allow for future resizing updates
* A 'SSV' option has been added to export types on the shopping list and other areas. SSV is semicolon separated and also outputs EU style decimals (e.g 1.000,00). 
* T3 production has been converted to invention and can now use Decryptors.
* Number of BPs used (NumBps) has been updated to work for the new industry changes. Currently a high number of BPs will slow the program down. A fix to make this processing more efficient will come next patch.

BP Tab

* The tab has been reorganized to allow for Facilities and Teams (not enabled). 
* BP facilities types and activities will automatically load for the BP selected. For instance, T1 items without components will only show manufacturing. However, a T2 item will show Copy, Invention, Manufacturing, and Component Manufacturing options. 
* All facilities will have a usage check for that facility type. This information is used in calculations including invention and copying. 
* The Calc tab for T2 and T3 will show invention and copy (T2 only) costs. These costs are in addition to usage and will include any materials (datacores, etc) to do the activity. For copying, most items will be 0 but in some cases (such as Cloaking devices), the materials' cost will be set here.
* Double-clicking interfaces have been added to labels for Invention and Copy Costs to see the materials and usage of the activity.
* Additional Costs are now saved with the Blueprint on the BP Tab
* Users can save relics and Decryptor types when saving a BP if selected in settings.

Update Prices

* New items from previous DBs are now available
* Percentile pricing should now use the correct prices

Manufacturing Tab

* Several types of Facilities have been added to the manufacturing tab. Each type will allow users to set specific facilities to build various groups of items such as capitals, supers, and items that cannot be built in a pos (sov items).
* Several new columns have been added to the list of fields users can choose on the tab. Default columns are similar to v2.3. Users can also move the order and resize the width of the columns in the table. 
* Num BPs has been added to the options with runs and lines.

Datacores - Gallente and Amarr datacore skills should now correctly show in the comparison table.

Reactions Tab - Reactions were updated with the reaction types

Mining Tab

* All reprocessing formulas and changes with Crius mining changes are live.
* The data grid now will show what type of ore processing type to allow comparison of Refined, Compressed, and Unrefined ores together based on the options selected. 
* Includes name changes to mining lasers.

BP Management

* Blueprint data is now downloaded via the API automatically on startup (unless disabled in settings). Please delete your old BP list if needed to get a fresh set of downloads. Multiple BP support is still not available.
* Only BPOs with the highest ME value are automatically set as owned.
* Additional options to assist in updating BPs has been added.

Industry Jobs

* Industry jobs have been updated for the updates to the industry API. Current and history are available as per the length of viewable time per CCP.
* Users can now view the industry jobs of any character they have loaded in the Account Management area with the correct rights. 
* Users can select the characters in the right hand corner to update the industry jobs.
* New columns have been added to the industry jobs viewer.
* The number of current and total jobs will be shown next to the character name in the list of characters (2/10 = 2 jobs of 10 possible)

Disabled Features due to updates

* The Industry Success tool has been disabled until a work around with the new API is identified
* The POS settings have been temporarily disabled.
* The ignore options on the BP tab have been temporarily removed.
* Data for stations and station upgrades have been temporarily removed.

Build 2.3.5188.30573

New Stuff

Asset Viewer
* Added a new Asset Viewer for Personal and Corp assets, which will show locations for all assets based on your API.
* Users can select the new Asset Viewer for viewing from the View menu or from the button on the Shopping list.
* Users can update Assets and timers for each type of Asset API will be displayed when the next API query is allowed. 
* Saving settings on the Asset Viewer will save the locations of boxes checked in the Asset tree as well as any search settings. 
* Search settings are similar to the Update Prices but can be separated by build items (anything you could use in a BP).
* Selected items will NOT auto-select containers that are children of the tree node. This is by design. If a builder were to want to update a shopping list with all items they have in Jita 4-4, including containers, they need to select all containers as well. 
* Saving settings from the View * > Assets selection has limited functionality currently. 
* For items in Space (POS towers), the Asset Viewer currently only shows limited information and does not link particular POS modules to a specific tower. This is a limitation of the Asset API and will be corrected (hopefully) in a future update.

Industry Upgrade Belts Tool 
* Added a new tool under the Tools menu that displays IPH per Industry upgrade belts assuming a full flip.
* Users can enter the number of miners in their fleet, average cycle time, m3 per cycle, and Refining Station data to see IPH, Ore Volume, approximate total ISK, and approximate hours to flip.
* Added options for ore types by truesec of the system
* Added options to include broker fees and taxes, as well as compression for determining total Ore Volume of the belt.
* Under each belt, users can select ores they want to ignore if they are looking to 'Cherry Pick' for instance.

Completely Rebuilt Shopping List
* Rebuilt the shopping list to give more room, functionality, options, and update with Assets.

Asset update 
* Click on the Safe icon to open the Asset Viewer for selecting the update location for the Shopping List. Any settings saved for this Asset Viewer will apply only to the Shopping List. 
* Clicking on the 'Update with Selected Assets' will update the shopping list and remove quantities of materials you have on hand. 
* Clicking on the 'Copy and Paste Assets' will allow users to copy and paste materials from the in game hanger view (list of assets, not icons) and paste them into the shopping list for update. The Rule for any list pasted into the list is Name of Item, Quantity. 
* If the 'Update Assets When Used' option is selected, IPH will update your currently stored assets by subtracting 'Used' materials in the shopping list after Updating with Selected Assets.

Save and Load shopping lists
* Saving a shopping list will output the list to csv format. 
* Loading a shopping list must be in the same format as the saved list but will update the shopping list based on the current BP Tab options selected (i.e. Build/Buy). If users save different quantities of materials, or do not include materials in the list, then loading a list will take that into account. For example, Item A takes 1000 Trit to build but was updated to 500 Trit then the list was saved. When loading the list, an option on the BP tab adds 100 Trit to the build requirements giving 1100 needed. Based on saved list data, the shopping list will update to 600 Trit to buy.

Updating / Deleting
* Users can remove any item, component, or material from the lists buy right clicking and choosing 'Delete'
* To delete multiple items from the list, hold control and click each row you want to delete and right click, choose Delete.
* Users can update Quantity and Price in the Items to Buy list. Price updates will apply to the entire program. 
* Users can update the Quantity in the Items and Components to Build lists.
* If a user updates the total amount of materials in the Buy list, then updates quantity in the Components or Items lists, IPH will take into account the amount of that material you have 'on hand' as indicated through your update (i.e. if you need 1000 and you change the quantity to 400, that means you have 600 on-hand).

Broker Fees
* Brokers fees for items you buy on market will be applied in the shopping list. Fees will apply for all items marked with 'Buy Order' or as described in rules for 'Calculate Buy / Buy Order' option.
* Added a new column to the shopping list that IPH will display to help determine whether you should buy the item directly from the market or set up a buy order - sometimes it's cheaper to buy direct!
* When the 'Calculate Buy / Buy Order' option is selected, IPH will attempt to determine if it's better to set up a buy order or buy from posted sell orders (no tax/no fees).
* Rules for Broker Fee calculations:
-If the Fees is checked and Calculate Buy/Buy Order, then IPH will calculate difference.
-If the Fees is unchecked, IPH assumes then the user is buying all materials from active sell orders, and no Broker fee will be assigned.
-If Fees is checked and Calculate Buy/Buy Order is not, then IPH assumes the user is using all buy orders to obtain materials.
-If Fees is unchecked, then Calculate Buy/Buy Order will be disabled
-To calculate whether it the item is Buy/Buy Order based on stored prices, IPH uses the following rules:
* If the user enters a manual price, or imports any 'Sell' price - IPH uses that price as minimum sell and imports max buy
* If the user imports any 'Buy' or 'All' price then IPH uses that price as max buy and import minimum sell
* IPH will only use items marked with 'Buy Order' to calculate total Brokers Fees.

Other stuff
* Users can select the Item names from the lists for copy purposes only.
* Double-clicking on an Item or Component will load that Item or Component in the BP Tab.
* Added an 'Always on Top' option that will force the shopping list window on top of all other windows you have active on your computer - Useful for windowed mode shopping.
* Added Total Item Tax and Total Item Broker Fees which is the total tax and fees for the 'Items to Build' in the list. The Broker Fees here do not apply to the 'Fees' under options.

General Updates
* Augmented and Integrated drones are now set as 'Pirate' and not 'Navy' Types
* Refinery and Station Efficiency is now set as percentages instead of decimals (e.g. 5% vs. 0.05)
* Usage costs have been correctly updated. 
- Usage will now take into account Discount or Surcharge depending on values and standings set in program settings.
- Note 1) Usage is applied per run regardless of runs or bps. 
- Note 2) Usage values won't be exact because in game CCP rounds up corporation standings for display but uses unrounded values in calculations, so I can't get the exact value to do calculations.
* Renamed 'Tools' for selections to 'Misc.' on the BP, Update Prices, and Manufacturing Tabs. Misc. will include, Fuel Blocks, Implants, Data Interfaces, and Tools. For Update Prices, it includes random other items as well.

Blueprint Tab
* Added a 'Fees' check box and label for Brokers Fees in addition to Taxes and Usage.

* Double-clicking on a component in the Component Material List will now load that BP in the BP tab with displayed ME and Runs.
* Added several tool tips to help clarify different areas.
* Outposts, Outpost upgrades, and Custom Offices have been added as 'Blueprints' and updated to act like other blueprints that take multiple components. For example, an Amarr Outpost will take an 'Egg' plus items to put in the Egg to deploy. Selecting the Amarr Outpost 'Blueprint' will now show the total items to deploy a full outpost. Upgrades and Customs offices work similarly.

Update Prices Tab
* Added Percentile prices for selection from EVE Central, which they define as: [If you sold to the top 5% (in volume, not just orders), and took the total price, that would be percentile. For sell, it's as if you've bought 5% of the market (in volume), lowest price first.] 
* The Shattered Villard Wheel can now have its price downloaded or set.

* Sovereignty Structure Blueprints will now appear under 'Structures' in the Blueprint Selection Combo.

Update Prices Tab
* Added ability to split price downloads for items and raw materials by any price provided by the EVE Central API. I.e. you can set max buy for raw materials and min sell for items to maximize efficiency, or min sell for raw materials and max buy for items to maximize turnaround time.
* Added Asteroids to Update Price list for use in the Mining Tab and Compressed Blueprint Calculations.
* Returned item prices from EVE Central that are zero will no longer overwrite existing prices. In cases where EVE Central does not report a price, but you have one set, IPH will maintain the old price. This will help with manual price updates where EVE Central continually has no record to return.

Manufacturing Tab
* Added Production Time Modifier combo and all possible time modifiers.
* Added production runs to the Manufacturing Tab. This will be the total number of production lines that is used for manufacturing calculations to better reflect what you are building (i.e. 10 lines of Shield Booster II instead of 1 line per production run). This change will be apparent in SVR calculations rather than regular calculations. Enter the data manually or double click to enter max production runs for your character.
* Users will now export data in the manufacturing tab list to CSV through file export instead of using the clipboard.

Reactions Tab
* Refining with alchemy now uses refining equipment efficiency and tax rates set in the program settings.

* Users can now enter m3/hour for mining drones to add to yield per hour. Note the value here is your own estimate given your own mining setup and not based on your skills.
* Added Tooltip to Mining Foreman GangLink to highlight cycling through No Link, T1 or T2
* Added the ability to compare refining or not refining mined ice and ore, useful if you don't have good refining capabilities or want to just sell quickly and want to find the best ore or ice to mine. 
* If .75 refining yield is selected, calculations will assume a Refining Array is being used and will use calculations for Refining Arrays instead of Stations and cap the refining rate at .75.
* Shown yield rates were not accurately reflecting the true yield or affect by taxes. This has been fixed.

Shopping List
* Added ME values to shopping list exports for all items that have an ME value set in the program.
* Added the total built volume to the shopping list screen and copy exports. This will be the total volume of the items list after they are built.

Blueprint Management

* Added tool tips explaining what is backed up and loaded for the Backup and Load BP buttons.

Program Settings
* Added Default Build/Buy and Default Build Equipment Modifier settings for use in the Blueprints and Manufacturing Tabs.
* Added Default Refinery Efficiency and Tax Settings for use in Mining and Reactions.
* Updated the names of 'Beancounter' Implants to recent name changes. The values should properly work now when set.

General
* Added correct material list for Drone Damage Amplifier II (due to CCP hotfix following Inferno).
* Updated Invention Runs Formula based on Inferno Expansion Patch. Basic change to the invention runs formula is that max run BPCs are no longer required to get the 1 run from the BPC in addition to the Decryptor bonus. For example: A 1 run BPC before using a User Manual (+2 Runs) would result in 2 runs. After Inferno you get 3 (1 from BPC and +2 from Decryptor). Note: this change seems to work for my testing but let me know if you notice a discrepancy with the data on screen and what you expect.
